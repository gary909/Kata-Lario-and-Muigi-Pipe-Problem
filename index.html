      Issue<br />
      <br />
      Looks like some hoodlum plumber and his brother has been running around<br />
      and damaging your stages again.<br />
      <br />
      The pipes connecting your level's stages together need to be fixed before
      <br />
      you receive any more complaints. Each pipe should be connecting, since
      <br />
      the levels ascend, you can assume every number in the sequence after the
      <br />
      first index will be greater than the previous and that there will be no
      duplicates.<br />
      <br />
      Task<br />
      <br />
      Given the a list of numbers, return the list so that the values increment
      <br />
      by 1 for each index up to the maximum value.<br />
      <br />
      Example<br />
      <br />
      Input: 1,3,5,6,7,8<br />
      <br />
      Output: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8<br />
